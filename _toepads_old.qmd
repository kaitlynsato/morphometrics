# Toepads 

Toepads are modified pads on the tips of the toes and fingers of many species of Asterophryinae frogs that help with clinging. Arboreal species have the most developed and largest toepads, whil some species (particularly fossorial or burrowing species) may have hardly and visible toepad. 

Here are some photos that we took under a dissecting scope and 32x and with 6x magnification by the camera.

Toepads of a scansorial species with well-developed toepads. Many arboreal and scansorial species have larger finger pads than toe pads. It is from Cliffside camp, Kamiali on the EPCT of the mainland.

_Cophixalus cheesemanae_ is a scansorial _Cophixalus_ often found on palms and even bananas. It is a good climber. From Cliffside camp, Kamiali.

# Callulops

![Toe pad](toepads/cliffside/Callulops_personatus_toe_IMG_0656.jpg){#fig-callulopstoe}

_Callulops personatus_ is a large fossorial (burrowing) species. It is one of the largest of all Asterophryinae. It is hard to see toepads, there may be some modified skin that blends into the rest of the toe. From Cliffside camp, Kamiali.

# Barygenys

![Toe pad](toepads/cliffside/Barygenys sp._toe_IMG_0630.jpg){#fig-barygenystoe}

_Barygenys sp._ is a small fossorial (burrowing) species. It is really hard to see toepads as this is a small species. The contrast has been adjusted here to see the slight difference in skin texture. From Cliffside camp, Kamiali.
